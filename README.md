# Grocery-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview
The dataset represents grocery sales data across multiple U.S. cities and categories. 
The raw sales file did not include total sales values, so data transformation was performed to calculate revenue for each transaction and derive key business insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed using Python.

## Key Steps:

- Loaded all seven CSV files from the dataset.
- Identified that the main Sales file lacked total sales values.
- Merged the Product and Sales datasets using the Product ID field.
- Calculated Total Sales = Unit Price × Quantity Sold.
- Performed exploratory analysis to understand: -City-wise and category-wise performance, Top-selling products, Monthly revenue patterns
- Power BI Dashboard
## The Revenue Dashboard highlights:
- Total Revenue: 4.47B
- Total Quantity Sold: 88M
- Top 10 Cities: Tucson, Jackson, Sacramento, etc.
- Top 5 Products: Bread (Calabrese), Shrimp (31/40), Tia Maria, etc.
